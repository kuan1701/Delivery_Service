## Initialization and launch of the project

To launch the application correctly, you need:
- Download and uncompress the .zip archive of this repository. I recommend cloning a project (if you know Git):  
    `$ git clone https://github.com/kuan1701/Delivery_Service.git`
- Go to the Application package and open the DeliveryApp. 
- Press Shift + Alt + F10 on your keyboard and select DeliveryApp from the pop-up window.
